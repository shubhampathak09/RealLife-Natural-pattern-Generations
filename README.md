Processing is Java based framework, that allows us to have a graphic based visualisation.
P5.js is equivalent of the same, just uses the javascript in that sense, Some little aspects of code change
-Most of the projects in this cover, various mathematical as well as physical, from basic divide and conqueror
Algorithms visualisations like convex hull, to complex image processing algos, such terrain gen,mapping 3d and 2d 
curve spaces, Non Euclidean Geometery and more
-Quite many other examples have also been planned such as Fractals,perlion noise,search algorithms, convex hulls
image processing algo like flood fill etc
-will be updating the repo regularly
- references coding train,computer phile,george not found for minecraft procedural terrrain generations
-thinking to cover some algos for procedurial terrain gen in Javascript, will provide a Java based implementation
as well
-Mathematical curves,that naturally occur in nature such as fibonacci spirals etc
-path finding and Maze generations are also, planned maybe a basic bfs,dfs visualtions and A*search could be added as well

-adding an image cab be tricky
